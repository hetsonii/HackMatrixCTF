Enter the flag in this format - THMXPU{thm_parul} ( Everything in Lowercase )

### Solution:

Step 1: Open the file in Wireshark.
Step 2: Follow the TCP stream of the last packet and show the data as raw to retrieve the bytes of the zip file.
Step 3: Save the wordlist found [here](https://github.com/cyberwali7/Arre-arre-arre-arre/blob/main/Ye%20alag%20hee%20level%20ka%20flag%20h%20.txt)
Step 4: Use the wordlist to crack the zip file's password with following script:
```python
import binascii
import zipfile
import io

# The hex string representing the ZIP file
hex_data = "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"

# Convert hex string to bytes
zip_data = binascii.unhexlify(hex_data)

# Use an in-memory bytes buffer to treat the byte data as a zip file
zip_buffer = io.BytesIO(zip_data)

# Path to the file with passwords (each password on a new line)
password_file_path = 'wordlist1.txt'

# Open the zip file
with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_buffer, 'r') as zip_file:
    # List the contents of the zip file
    zip_file.printdir()

    # Open the file with passwords
    with open(password_file_path, 'r') as password_file:
        # Try each password from the file
        for pwd in password_file:
            pwd = pwd.strip()  # Remove any extra whitespace/newline characters
            try:
                # Attempt to extract the files with the current password
                print(f"Trying password: {pwd}")
                zip_file.extractall("extracted_files", pwd=pwd.encode())  # Password needs to be bytes
                print(f"Success! The correct password is: {pwd}")
                break
            except (RuntimeError, zipfile.BadZipFile):
                print(f"Failed to extract with password: {pwd}")
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
```

Step 5: Extract the zip file with the password found using following script:
```python
import binascii
import zipfile
import io

# The hex string
hex_data = "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"

# Convert hex string to bytes
zip_data = binascii.unhexlify(hex_data)

# Use an in-memory bytes buffer to treat the byte data as a zip file
zip_buffer = io.BytesIO(zip_data)

# Ask for the password
password = input("Enter the password for the encrypted zip file: ").encode()

# Open the zip file
with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_buffer, 'r') as zip_file:
    # List the contents of the zip file
    zip_file.printdir()

    # Try to extract the contents with the password
    try:
        zip_file.extractall("extracted_files", pwd=password)
        print("Contents extracted to 'extracted_files' directory.")
    except RuntimeError as e:
        print(f"Failed to extract the file. Reason: {e}")
```

Step 6: Open the extracted file and find the flag hash.
Step 7: Crack the hash using following script:
```python
import hashlib

def crack_sha256_hash(hash_to_crack, wordlist_file):
    try:
        # Open the wordlist file
        with open(wordlist_file, 'r') as wordlist:
            for word in wordlist:
                word = word.strip()  # Remove newline characters

                # Hash the word using SHA-256
                hashed_word = hashlib.sha256(word.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()

                # Compare the hashed word with the target hash
                if hashed_word == hash_to_crack:
                    print(f"Hash cracked! The password is: {word}")
                    return

        print("Password not found in wordlist.")

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Wordlist file '{wordlist_file}' not found.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Replace with your SHA-256 hash and wordlist path
hash_to_crack = '72b2101e358950e04554187d244be259d55054e7cb11354b0b7d9e6c932a7031'
wordlist_file = 'wordlist1.txt'

crack_sha256_hash(hash_to_crack, wordlist_file)
```
